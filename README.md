## Project BAckground

CloudOps Solutions is a growing company that recently adopted AWS to manage its cloud infrastructure. As the company scales, they have decided to automate the process of managing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources. This includes the creation of users, user groups, and the assignment of permissions for new hires, especially for their DevOps team.
